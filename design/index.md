Design Notes
============

We need an artists brief
---------
An artist is going to need to know things like

* What kind of images
* How many images
* Interrelationships
* How will they be used
* How big
* What should they feel like?
* What is their purpose?
* Real or Abstract?
* How mathematical if at all?
