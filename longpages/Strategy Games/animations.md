Please can we have a general nim interactive? Ideally it would allow a user to play against the computer or against another user.

Ideally it would be designed so you could play:
1. with counters (any number of piles and each pile containing any number of counters), simplest version being like Nim-7 (id 1204), but being adaptable like (id 1274), also being able to play Last Biscuit (id 2656)
2. with numbers like Got It (id 1272)
3. with a particular spatial arrangement, like a spiral (see Liz) and something like Slippery Snail (id 1210)

No idea if I've given you enough info here or whether this is feasible in terms of being different 'views' of the same interactive
