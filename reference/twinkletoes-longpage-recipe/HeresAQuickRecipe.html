<h2 id="common-to-all-pages">Common to all pages?</h2>
<p>Try to make the page a standalone document that hits your target age group.</p>
<p>Start with a welcoming hook. Something to gain interest, some questions that need to be resolved -- whatever it takes</p>
<p>Collect the tasks together in some useful order.</p>
<p>Say 'Send us what you've done' in interestingly different ways at regular intervals.</p>
<p>Throw in some ephemera -- anything to keep it light hearted and welcoming.</p>
<p>End with some follow up suggestions, further reading, links. Invitations to submit.</p>
<h2 id="set-up">Set up</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Make a folder for the page in DropBox or Google Drive - let's call it <em>twinkletoes</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Inside twinkletoes, collect all the assets that are going to live in the page -- images, videos, sounds, artwork, notes -- whatever reference material you need.</p></li>
<li><p>Edit a narrative for the page in markdown. You might start by using the <a href="http://stackedit.io">online editor</a> -- you type markdown on the left of the page and it displays the resulting html page on the right. Later on you'll find it convenient to switch to a text editor like <code>Sublime Text</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>You can include any maths in the normal way -- <span class="math"><em>y</em> = <em>x</em><sup>2</sup></span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="add-images-in-roughly-the-right-place">Add images in roughly the right place</h2>
<p>StackEdit or Sublime will create an html page for you. Save this in <code>twinkletoes</code>, view it in a browser. Then start inserting images.</p>
<p>It's easy enough to add them with markdown syntax e.g.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="goose.jpg" alt="Here&#39;s a demented goose" /><p class="caption">Here's a demented goose</p>
</div>
<p>would refer to the file <code>goose.jpg</code> in <code>twinkletoes</code>, and give it a caption <code>Here's a demented goose</code>.</p>
<h2 id="work-up-the-design-with-mike-and-any-other-volunteers">Work up the design with Mike (and any other volunteers)</h2>
<p>Add in videos, sounds, artwork. Worry about layout, choice of font, colour, background graphics, animations, interactives, different screen widths, etc. etc.</p>
